    GAMEPLAY

Levels starting with '?' are not in order and use concepts not yet introduced,
but I've included them anyway.

When editing, there are two grids: the one on the left is the puzzle you're
creating, and the one on the right is used to select the surface/block to place
in the puzzle.

    CONTROLS

Global:
 - F10: minimise
 - F11/alt+enter: toggle fullscreen

Menu:
 - arrow keys: change selection; left/right change selector options
 - alt + left/right: change number selectors more quickly
 - ctrl + left/right: select first/last selector option
 - enter, space: click a button; select/deselect a text entry
 - escape, backspace: go back; quit; deselect a text entry
 - press the first character of an option to select it (and click it if it's
   the only one starting with that character)

Puzzle:
 - WASD, arrow keys: move; right steps forwards through moves when auto-solving
                     is paused (see below)
 - ctrl + arrow keys: move, but only when you're holding at least two
                      directions (diagonal movement can be hard otherwise)
 - QEZX: move diagonally; both this and WASD are nice in Dvorak if you select
         it in the options menu
 - R: reset
 - tab, F8, slash, backslash (hold): fast-forward auto-solving; hold ctrl for
                                     even faster fast-forward
 - enter, space: pause/unpause auto-solving
 - escape, backspace: pause

Editor:
 - WASD, arrow keys: move selection (either grid)
 - shift/alt + arrow keys: resize grid
 - escape, backspace: pause; if the second grid is selected, switch to the main
                      grid
 - tab, F8, slash, backslash: switch the selection to the other grid
 - enter, space, i, insert: insert a block into the current tile in the main
                            grid
 - delete, d: remove any block/surface (block only if both are present) from
              the current tile in the main grid
 - U, ctrl + Z: undo
 - ctrl + R, ctrl + shift + Z, ctrl + Y: redo
 - R: reset the puzzle to the original state (blank if new, or what was loaded)
      (cannot be undone)

Editor mouse control:
 - left-click selects the grid/tile under the pointer, if any
 - right-click deletes the block/surface under the pointer (block first, like
   with the keyboard)
 - middle-click-drag resizes the grid

    KNOWN ISSUES

 - the keyboard layout setting requires a restart to take effect.
 - going to fullscreen then back to windowed ends up with a maximised window on
   Linux.
 - on Windows, the mouse cursor might not move smoothly.  (XP?  Old graphics
   cards?)
 - on Windows, mouse control might be entirely broken (same again).
